Dear <%= @order.buyer_name %>,

This message is to inform you that we attempted to bill your credit card but it was unsuccessful.

This is in reference to your card ending in: <%= @card_last_4 %>

The failure message is:
<%= @msg %>

We will try once more in a little while.  If the charge is unsuccessful again, the order will be cancelled and the seller will be notified.

Thank you,
