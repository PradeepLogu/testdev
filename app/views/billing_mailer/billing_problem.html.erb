<h2>We had a problem billing your account</h2>
Thank you for using TreadHunter to sell your tires.  Our records show that there was a problem charging
your credit card for the TreadHunter service.  In order to ensure continued
service, and non-removal of existing listings, you will need to provide a valid credit card to bill immediately.<br />
You can use this link: <a href="http://www.treadhunter.com/pages/cc_info">here</a> to enter a card.<br />
Again, thank you for allowing TreadHunter.com to help your business grow.
